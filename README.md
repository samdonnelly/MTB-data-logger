Note: This project is now archived and no longer maintained. References to code from other repositories may be out of date. 

Data logging system for mountain bikes used to better understand suspension setup and riding characteristics. The system records suspension position, wheel speed, geographical location and acceleration in real time which can then be used to determine a variety of bike and rider characteristics in post processing. The software runs on an STM32F4 and uses my <a href="https://github.com/samdonnelly/STM32F4-driver-library">STM32F4-driver-library</a> to communicate with external devices.
