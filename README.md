# MTB Data Logger

<h5>This repo contains the code for a mountain bike data logger. The system attaches to my mountain bike and records data such as front and rear suspension position, wheel speed, bike orientation and geographic location. This data is used to tune my suspension and observe my riding style.</h5>

<h5>The project uses an STM32F411RE on a NUCLEO development board. My <a href="https://github.com/samdonnelly/STM32F4-driver-library.git">STM32F4 library</a> is used by this project for device and communication drivers. I use STM32CubeMX to generate the base code such as register definitions and the Makefile but I write the the application code. My code can be found in the the "sources" and "headers" folders.</h5>

<h5>Check out my <a href="https://samueldonnelly11.wixsite.com/builds">Project Website</a> for pictures and more details on the mechanical and electrical design and build of this project.</h5>
