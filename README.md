# MTB Data Logger

Data logging system for mountain bikes used to better understand suspension setup and riding characteristics. The system records suspension position, wheel speed, geographical location, bike orientation and acceleration in real time which can then be used to determine dynamic sag, bike balace, suspension characteristics and personal riding information. The software runs on the STM32F4 and uses the <a href="https://github.com/samdonnelly/STM32F4-driver-library">STM32F4-driver-library</a> to communicate with external devices. Data recorded by the system can later be analyzed using scripts also included in this repository.
